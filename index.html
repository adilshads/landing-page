            I have traveled through several regions of the world and have witnessed their customs, habits and religions. Everywhere I have
            found people of different races and creeds who are friendly, hospitable, and kind. Although their way of life may be different 
            from ours, they all share a common humanity. It is easy to make friends with people from different backgrounds when you travel, 
            as you are all in the same boat and have to rely on each other. Through travel, one becomes more tolerant and accepting of 
            others, and this can only be a good thing for humanity.
